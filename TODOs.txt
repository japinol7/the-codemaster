## TODOs & Wishlist ##

Known bugs:

> Sometimes the actor is stuck, not moving, and changing its direction:
    > This issue rarely happens.
    > This issue happens when the position of the actor is out of their
      movement borders.

> Energy shield issues:
  > Energy shield activation sprites placement.

> Vertical borders for moving actors are buggy, such as snakes.
  > Cannot correctly persist vertical moving actors
    when they are not initially in a game level.



Future Improvements:

> General:
  > Consider avoiding putting items inside platforms.

> Levels creation:
  > Consider creating the levels gradually:
    > Right now, all the levels are created when starting
      or continuing a game.

> Persistence:
  > When using persistence, do not create actors that
    will be killed anyway when loading the saved game data.
  > Initialize random attributes of some actors only once,
    instead of calculating the value at instantiation
    and changing them later with the persisted information.
    > Example: potions.

> Settings:
  > Allow users to use a gamepad.
  > Let users introduce their names.
  > Screen to show scores.

> Game play:
  > Add elements, more magic spells and more skills.
  > Improve level up system

> Clean code and refactoring improvements:
  > Add more comments and documentation to the code.
  > Refactor game input events management.
  > Improve data models.
  > Refactor the settings module.
