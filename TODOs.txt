## TODOs & Wishlist ##

Known bugs:

> Sometimes when persisting moving actors, the actor is stuck
  not moving and changing direction:
    > This happens when the position of the actor is out of its
      movement borders.

> Energy shield issues:
  > Energy shield activation sprites placement.

> Vertical borders for moving actors are buggy, such as snakes.
  > Cannot correctly persist vertical moving actors
    when they are not initially in a game level.





Future Improvements:

> General:
    > Consider avoiding putting items inside platforms.
    > Finish the basic game.

> Settings:
    > Allow users to use a gamepad.
    > Let users introduce their names.
    > Screen to show scores.

	> Add elements, more magic spells and more skills.
    > Improve level up system

> Clean code and refactoring improvements:

	> Refactor game input events management.  
	> Improve data models.
	> Refactor settings module.





Future Possible Networking Version:

> Networking:
	> Client/server option so the players can play on the net.
	    > One player will run the server version and the client
	      version for its game.
	    > Other players will run the client version and will be assigned
	      to the game available that he chooses.
	    > Allow several players to play in the same game.
